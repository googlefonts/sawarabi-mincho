## About Sawarabi Fonts

Sawarabi Fonts are Japanese font families which are make up of two fonts,
gothic and mincho.  Sawarabi Gothic is a ‘Japanese gothic’ font, which is
similar to sans-serif.  Sawarabi Mincho is a ‘mincho’ font.  ‘Mincho’ means a
Ming typeface and is used like a serif font in Japan.

Sawarabi Gothic and Mincho are normal ordinary fonts and have not notable
features. But it can be said that their design concept might be a little
traditional (or old fashioned), if compared with
[VL Gothic](http://dicey.org/vlgothic/) and [M+ FONTS](https://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp/)
which have already been popular as free Japanese fonts.

Though both of fonts are available, they have not yet enough characters for
daily use, such as standard kanji, for being under developing now.
